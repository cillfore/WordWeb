# WordWeb
Visualize Your Language!

Before I made the decision to learn to code, I had begun this art project where I wanted to map out a dictionary (like this) on paper. I spent maybe two hours writing words out individually before I had the eureka moment that led me down the path of software development. That was around Winter 2016. The hurdles of learning data structures, algorithms, finishing my degree, and getting a dev-job started to take priority, leaving this project dead in the water for... nearly eight years.

The original ethos of the project was to highlight the fickleness of words, to try and get the feeling across that a single word has no inherent meaning, since it is reliant on the web of words surrounding it. I recently watched Arrival for the first time and had that same feeling again. Additionally, I've started using Obsidian this year, which has a very simple to use graph view. It felt like a no-brainer to throw this together, given the work of visualizing the graph has already been done for me.

So that's what this does. Given a CSV dictionary, this will build a vault for Obsidian, with the sole purpose of seeing every words definition(s) in the sprawling graph that makes up the language. It's far from perfect, but for my purposes (simply seeing the mess), it is more than sufficient. I would like to see other languages as well, but finding good dictionary files is a bit cumbersome, and I'm afraid it isn't that worth it to me. Maybe next decade!

# Time
Obsidian completely chokes around 16k words on my current computer, and it takes several hours to reach that point. The files themselves will generate in around 10secs on my machine.

# Dictionary Source
The dictionary included here was sourced from this repo: https://github.com/benjihillard/English-Dictionary-Database.
